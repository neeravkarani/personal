## Comments
 - You have to understand that the Vineyard is the place that rich people go to do nothing. By most any standard, the beaches aren't great, it's colder than the mainland, there's not much there but sporadic tourist shops, candy, ice cream, over-priced restaurants. **Provincetown** is the better day trip from Boston. Take the high-speed ferry there and back and see a fun town at the end of the cape.
